# Library-Files-for-other-Repository-Apps

Some of these files will need to be copied into project or added via 'Add as Link'. Normally the namespace below would be proceeded by the project name but is ommitted so files can be shared between projects easily. Common namespace LibraryCoder is used instead.  I chose 'Add as Link' since any edits will apply to any Apps that use these library files.
